What can you do with WebOS?
Thinks like that:

Even, oop-driven, event-driven, high level coding... You don't worry abot how your browser refresh your state window or window controsl. WebOS make it for you!!! You just must think in concrete actions like open(), addControl(), addButton(), or event subscription like bind('click', function() { ... });

With WebOS you gonna write desktop oriented UIs without mess to do it. Common tasks and visual elements are pre-built. 

Your users never loses their session state... They can shutdown their desktop machines at end of workday... and next day start with same state than previous session... If you need shutdown your server, you don't worry about your users. At restarting all will be found like last time.
